                <h3>Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks</h3>
                <p>Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this image recognition system can classify images into
                     1000 different categories with high accuracy. Trained on the ImageNet dataset, the model demonstrates the efficacy
                      of deep learning in computer vision tasks.</p>

                <h3>Chatbot Development using Sequence-to-Sequence Models</h3>
                <p>This project involves creating a conversational agent using a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanisms. 
                The chatbot is trained on a dataset of dialogues to perform tasks ranging from customer service to engaging in small talk, 
                showcasing the versatility of neural network architectures in natural language processing.</p>

                <h3>Drug Discovery with Generative Adversarial Networks</h3>
                <p>Applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the field of medicinal chemistry, this project generates novel 
                    molecular structures for drug discovery. The model learns from known pharmacologically active compounds to propose
                     new candidates for drug development pipelines.</p>
